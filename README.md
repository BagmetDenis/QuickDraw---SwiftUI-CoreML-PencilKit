Recognition is basically classification, no matter what youâ€™re classifying, but in the interest of exploring a breadth of practical AI topics with you, here we build an app that lets you take a photo of a line-drawing and identify the drawing.

# What is QuickDraw

Quick, Draw! is an online game developed by Google that challenges players to draw a picture of an object or idea and then uses a neural network artificial intelligence to guess what the drawings represent.

In a game of Quick, Draw!, there are six rounds. Before each round, the player is given 20 seconds to draw a randomized object selected from the game's database. As they begin each round, they have 20 seconds to draw the given prompt, whilst the artificial intelligence attempts to guess the drawing, akin to a game of Pictionary. A round ends either when the artificial intelligence successfully guesses the drawing or the player runs out of time.
